# timepix_randomforest
Random forest for particle identification with MiniPIX-Timepix detector

The model is pickled in the file random_forest.pkl
The file Deploy_model shows a little code that deploys the model and use it on data from Timepix measurements.
The folder events_lists contains the data collected with Timepix. The detector was placed in a water phantom at the position (x=2.8,y=3.6 cm).
and irradiated with a 100 MeV collimated (apt100B2) and uncollimated (opf100B2) proton field.
